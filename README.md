Assignments for academic courses: Programming and Algorithms and Data Structures at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. 
Folders contain the following tasks

### Programming
List 1 - Vector class that holds collections of numbers<br />
List 2 - T1 find the date of exact Easter Holiday, T2 generating photo thumbnails in jpg., T3 make zip archive, T4 generating annual files modification statistics<br />
List 3 - T1 pack text files into one folder, T2 ... unpack them, T3 make backup of files with desired extensions, T4 change End Of Line signs <br />
List 4 - T1 solving equation of mathematic pendulum, T2 making gif of random walk of one agent on quadratic grid <br />
List 5 (GUI)- currency converter based on actual rates (with internet connection - if there is no internet access, the program works with the last downloaded data)<br />
List 6 (GUI)- program that draws graphs of functions<br />

### Algorithms and Data Structure
List 1 - Fraction class <br />
List 2 - T1 sorting functions depending on their asymptotic complexity, T2 solving the equation using a Pythagorean triple<br />
List 3 - T2 count needed multipliplications to calculate the value of the polynomial, T3 count how many times each character occurs in the text file (without using "if")<br />
List 4 - Queue BaB and BaE, UnorderedList, Stack, T4 program that checks the syntax of an HTML document<br />
List 5 - T1 analysis of computational complexity, T2 Tower of Hanoi problem, T3 Hilbert curve, T4 Koch curve<br />
List 6 - T1 class that implements binary search trees, T2 binary heap, T3 return the derivative of the given function<br /> 

In the subfolders of the given lists (algorithms) there are reports that describe my codes (in Polish)

### Technologies
